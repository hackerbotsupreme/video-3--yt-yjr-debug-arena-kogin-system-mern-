API 
api is the application programming , it is a type of middleware that allows two application 
to talk to each other . 
example , suppose we have a login form and wehave a database where we sstores users data now we want when ever 
the user ould fill the foorm and click on the submit there should be something which verify that user exist or not in our 
database so for that we need an api , so when the user would submit details it will send a request to the api 
please go and sheck if the user exists in databaseor not then api will send back request to the database and databse 
will send response that yes the user exists and the api will forward that to the website , so in this way all 
the  login authentication will happen .

login form -> api -> database 

here we will see how can we make api .

so first come to the root folder for our project then  
create a package.json using npm init (or npm init -y)
and to make an api we require to install some packages , 
we will use express (express is a framework of a node) -> npm install express
and we will use express to make an api 
and we will instll nodemon so that we can run our server smoothly -> npm install nodemon 
now everything is ready , noe the next step is 
create a  new folder app.js
